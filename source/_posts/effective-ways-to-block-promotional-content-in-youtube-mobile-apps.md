## What Are the Different Types of YouTube Ads?

Before we delve into the methods to stop YouTube ads, it’s essential to understand the various types of ads you might encounter while using the platform:

* **Skippable Video Ads**: These ads allow users to skip the ad after the first few seconds. They typically appear before or during a video.
* **Non-skippable Video Ads**: As the name suggests, you cannot skip these ads and must watch them in their entirety before proceeding to your desired video.
* **Overlay Ads**: These are semi-transparent ads that appear on the lower part of the video player and can be closed easily.
* **Bumper Ads**: Bumper ads are short, non-skippable video ads that usually last for a few seconds.
* **Display Ads**: Display ads appear as banners to the right of the video you’re watching or below the video suggestions.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ADGUARD-Android-Chrome-Compatibility-Issue.webp "ADGUARD-Android-Chrome-Compatibility-Issue")

However, there is a workaround. There is another variant of the AdGuard app available on the official website. You can [download the APK from here](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

[Download AdGuard APK](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) 

Please understand that this app cannot be published on the Google Play store due to Policy restrictions. So, you must install it directly from APK.

To Proceed, your Device must allow **installing Apps from Unknown sources**.

Tap the downloaded AdGuard APK file and then Install it. If installations from a browser are not allowed, you’ll get a notification. In this notification, **tap Settings → Allow from this source → Back → Install**.

After installation, you will be shown this Welcome page. **Click on Quick Setup** at the bottom.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AdGuard-Local-VPN-Quick-Setup.webp "AdGuard-Local-VPN-Quick-Setup")

To block ads, AdGuard uses Local VPN for filtering out ads from Google Chrome browser. It does not use remote server but traffic routing is done on local device itself.

To do that, click on **Create Local VPN** and Press OK on the prompt pop-up.
