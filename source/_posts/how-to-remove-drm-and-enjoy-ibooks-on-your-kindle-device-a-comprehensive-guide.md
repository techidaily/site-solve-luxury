Most of the people who like reading eBooks will choose the Kindle eReader, for its eye-friendly screen, and the gigantic Amazon eBookStore. As the magnate in eBooks area, Kindle insist his AZW format, ignoring the popular ePub format. 

In modern days, iTunes gift card is becoming a fashionable gift to family or friends. Cost gift card on iTunes eBooks is a splendid choice, but iPad is a bit expensive, and the screen is not that friendly to our eyes.

Therefore, buy books with iTunes gift card and read them on Kindle can benefit us most. But Kindle can't read iBooks directly, even if there is no DRM, the iBooks in ePub format, you still cannot read them on Kindle.

Don't worry, just 3 steps, you can **read iBooks on Kindle**

### 1\. Make iBooks convertable

**First of all**, find the iBooks you purchased in your computer. It always in the iTunes Library folder, the default path is X:\\My Documents\\My Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Books.

**Secondly**, download and install [the tool needed](http://download.epubor.com/sold/ibooksdrmremoval/requiem-4.1-mac.zip).

**Statement:** Epubor program **does not** support removing DRM from iBooks, and the tool above is not from Epubor.

### 2\. Convert ePub to Mobi

Download and install **[eBook Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ebook-converter/)**. Click **"Add"** and upload the DRM-free ePub ebook to this tool.

After converting epub to mobi, we can add iBooks to Kindle then read them by 3 methods.

**Method 1**: Connetc Kindle to PC by **USB cable**, there will be a Removable Disc in My Computer. Then put iBooks on Kindle by Copy & Paste the mobi file to the Document folder.

**Method 2**: Send the converted iBooks to your **Kindle e-mail** address. When you connect your Kindle to WIFI, the iBooks will transfer to your Kindle automatically. Find your Send-to-Kindle e-mail address in _Amazon.com---Manage your Kindle_.

### 4\. iBooks VS Kindle

1, **Eye-friendly screen** of Kindle. If we read on iPad for 1-2 hour, we easily get eye-tired, but for Kindle, this will not happen unless we read unless 3-4 hours.

2, **Battery life**. You are on a train-trip, reading a nice eBook with your iPad, suddenly, the iPad screen turns down because the battery has run out. But for Kindle, its battery can be at least last for a week without any charging.

3, **Weight.** The iPad is around 650g, while Kindle 3 is 240g and Kindle 4 is 170g. When we read eBooks, we often hold the eReader in our hands, it is tired if we hold iPad for 1-2 hours.

4, **District limit**. Most of eBooks in Amazon Store can only be purchased in the US. But Kindle is popular all over the world, while iBooks is available in many countries. Therefore, iBooks + Kindle = Best Reading.

Yup, the Requiem only works with iTunes 10.5/10.6, and the version after Requiem 3.3.6 even delete the iBooks decryption feature.

 I guess the developer might meet the pressure from Apple. Who knows?

I intended to draft you the very little word so as to thank you again on the remarkable knowledge you've discussed at this time. This has been simply seriously open-handed with you to grant unreservedly what exactly a number of people could have offered as an e book to help make some cash for their own end, chiefly given that you could possibly have done it if you ever desired. Those solutions as well acted as the good way to recognize that other individuals have a similar interest similar to my own to see a little more pertaining to this matter. I know there are a lot more pleasant occasions up front for many who examine your site.

The Requiem doesn't work so I finally found that Epubor has its own DMR removal so I just downloaded that and it all ended up working out. Now I can read all my ebooks from ibooks on my kindle app for android. 

 I recommend using Epubor, I just don't recommend using Requiem.
