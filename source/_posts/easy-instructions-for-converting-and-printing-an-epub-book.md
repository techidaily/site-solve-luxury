 As an open eBook format, EPUB is very popular among eBook lovers. Many of us may often download EPUB files online and enjoy them with our eBook devices or app. But sometimes it's necessary for us to print EPUB files to read them as paper books, especially for some textbooks or guide books. How to print an EPUB file? By following this guide, you will get the detailed information about how to print EPUB books.

### Step 1\. Remove DRM from EPUB Files

As we know, most of the EPUB files we purchased or downloaded online are always DRM-protected, such as Kobo, Nook, and Google Play books. So in order to print EPUB files, we should first remove the DRM protection. Therefore, a DRM Removal tool is needed. Here I would share with you a tool called [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), the best EPUB DRM Removal & EPUB Converter, with which you can remove DRM from EPUB and convert EPUB books to PDF with only one click.

**Notice:** If your EPUB files are DRM-free, you can just directly skip to [the Step 2 to convert EPUB to PDF](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### Case 1\. Remove Adobe DRM from Adobe EPUB files

Before removing Adobe DRM, please install [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html) on your computer first. Then authorize the Adobe Digital Editions with your Adobe ID, and then add your ePub books to Adobe Digital Editions to make sure you can read them with this program. This is a must step to ensure 100% success in converting the Adobe DRM ePub to PDF.

Now let's start removing Adobe DRM. It's very easy. Run Epubor Ultimate on your computer. If your Adobe Digital Editions books are saved in the default folder, Epubor Ultimate will detect and upload your EPUB books automatically. All your EPUB books will show up under "Adobe" icon on the left side. Now just drag EPUB books from the left side to the right main window of this program. And they will be decrypted soon.

For detailed information about removing Adobe DRM, please read [How to Remove DRM from Adobe Digital Editions](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### Case 2\. Remove Kobo DRM from Kobo EPUB books

If you download your kobo ebooks from Kobo for PC/Mac desktop, you can find your books under the "Kobo" tab at the left column of Epubor Ultimate. Just pick up the books, and drag and drop them from the left to the right column. You will find the Kobo ebooks are decrypted immediately. 

For detailed information about removing Kobo DRM, please read [Kobo DRM Removal, Remove DRM from Kobo EPUB Files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### Case 3\. Remove Nook DRM from Nook EPUB books

For removing Nook DRM, please download your Nook books from the Nook Windows app. It's also easy to operate. Just drag Nook books from the left side to the main interface of Epubor Ultimate to remove Nook DRM.

For detailed information about removing Nook DRM, please read [How to Remove Nook DRM (2023 Updated)](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Step 2\. Convert EPUB Files to PDF Format

Though we can directly print EPUB files with ADE, here I advise you to convert EPUB to PDF to get a better print quality and result. As [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) is also an eBook Converter tool, now we can use this tool to convert EPUB to PDF, no need to download another eBook converter tool. So convenient, right?

Just select PDF as the output format, hen click "Convert to PDF" button to start the conversion. Once the EPUB books have been converted PDF successfully, the output folder will pop up automatically which shows us all the converted PDF files.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Step 3\. Print out the file. 

After getting the converted PDF files, all that's left is to find a PDF reader with a printing function to open the PDF files. Click on the "Print" icon in the PDF reader, then choose the pages that you would like to print, customize the PDF files to meet your print demand, and start printing.

Now what we have to do is to enjoy our printed files. 

That's all I want to share with you about how to print an EPUB file. Do not forget to remove DRM if your EPUB files are protected by DRM, otherwise you cannot print EPUB books successfully!

Some ePub books you downloaded from online maybe drm free. But don't worry, Epubor Ultimate also works for converting non-drm ePub to PDF format. You can drag and drop those ePub files to Epubor Ultimate and choose the PDF outout and convert.

Does the application storages any information within the book? would it work offline?

 Thanks!

Hi,

 This program can work offline and it will find the key to decrypt your files once you sync it. 

 It won't storage any information of your eBooks.

Hi,

 How long does it take to convert to pdf ?

 I follow your instructions, here more than 70 minutes for a 49 mb Epub file and not finished yet...

 It is a bug ?
