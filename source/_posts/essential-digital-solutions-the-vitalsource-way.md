Epubor VitalSource Downloader is not accessing all of my titles for download. I can only access the most recently purchased lifetime purchase. There were 2 more titles I bought before that, and I can still access them through VtialSource. Is this a glitch?

Hi,

 I purchased Epubor Vitalsource downloader. I was trying to convert a textbook into a pdf file, but it failed. There was a output file, in which there is a phrase "Please refresh your browser" with a picture of a robot on all pages. I tried many times, but all failed. Please let me know how to solve this problem.

 Thanks
