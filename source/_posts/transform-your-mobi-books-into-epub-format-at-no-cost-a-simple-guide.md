It's known that Amazon Kindle eBook store provides much better and cheaper eBooks than others. As an eBook lover, you may often purchase interesting books on Kindle online eBook store. But some of the eBooks only provide Mobi format. So you can not read books on your Kobo, Nook, Sony or other eReaders which do not support Mobi format, but EPUB. If you want to read your Mobi books on more available devices, converting Mobi to EPUB free is the best way for you to work out the problem. In this article, I will tell you 3 useful methods that will help you convert Mobi to EPUB easily.

### Method1: Convert Mobi to EPUB with Calibre

Calibre is a powerful free software that can help you manage your eBooks and convert multiple format, including Mobi to EPUB. If you have not installed [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) on your computer, you can download it now. Next, follow me to learn how to convert Mobi to EPUB with Calibre.

**Step1: Add your downloaded books to Calibre**

You can just drag books to Calibre or click "Add" to load books. Then your books will show up at the main interface of Calibre.

**Step2: Convert Mobi to EPUB**

1\. Click "Convert books" on the top navigation bar.

### Method2: Covnert Mobi to EPUB free online

There are so many websites offering Mobi to EPUB online converter. In this part, I will take [Zamzar](http://www.zamzar.com/) and [Online Converter](http://ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-epub) for example.

1 Zamzar

Zamzar is a powerful online eBook converter. It provides bunch of eBook formats conversion. You can upload many books to the website at a time and convert them to the format you want. 

Just drag your Mobi books or click "Choose files" to add books. Select EPUB as output format, then enter your email address and click "OK" button to convert the format. It's so easy to use. When the conversion has been finished, Zamzar will send you an email, you need to click the link in your email to download your EPUB files.

![convert mobi to epub zamzar](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-mobi-to-epub-zamzar.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068439/7443" target="_top" id="2068439">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068439" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>
</a>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068439/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

In fact, I'm not very pleased with the Zamzar. Because everytime I convert my books, I always need to enter email address and download converted books from my email. It's complicated for me.

2 Online Converter

As a free online eBook converter, Online Converter supports mainstream formats, including EPUB, PDF and Mobi. It also provides some custom options for you to modify your eBook title, author, font and encoding. You can select target eBook reader to make the output files suit your devices. Just upload your Mobi files or enter a URL. Then click "Convert" button to convert the eBook format. 

![mobi to epub online ebooks converter](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/mobi-to-epub-online-ebook-converter.jpg)

But the Mobi to EPUB Online Convert doesn't have a batch mode. You can only add one book and convert format at a time. When the conversion completes, converted files download link will pop up. Just click it to download your EPUB files.
