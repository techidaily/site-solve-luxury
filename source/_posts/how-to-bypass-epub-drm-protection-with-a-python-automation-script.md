Since we're going to remove EPUB DRM with python script rar, let's learn something about python script rar first. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language whose design philosophy stresses code readability. It aims to combine "remarkable power with very clear syntax", and its standard library is large and comprehensive. Its use of indentation for block delimiters is unusual among popular programming languages. Except removing EPUB DRM, this one also supports removing DRM from PDF files. For more information about how to remove PDF DRM with this tool, refer to [this article](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) please.

Now follow me to remove EPUB DRM using python script rar. 

### Firstly, get tools ready

1Download [python script rar](https://www.epubor.com/images/remote/D4/1D/D41D8C%5FRemove-ePub-drm-use-python-script.rar). This file includes: Python 2.6.2, Pycrpto for WinXP, ineptkey.pyw and inepteput.pyw. If you don't adopt Windows XP, you need to download Bython 2.6 here: <https://www.python.org/downloads/> and download matched Pycrpto at >this website.

2Download [ineptepub.pyw](https://gitlab.com/ApprenticeAlf/DeDRM/blob/8b632e309fe4901bf0f21f404d2d3091fe7851da/Adobe%5FEPUB%5FTools/ineptepub.pyw) and ineptkey.pyw. Then place them into a same directory. (Rename your .pyw.txt file as .pyw.)

### Why we need to remove EPUB DRM

DRM (Data Rights Management) is applied by many online-ebookstores to protect the authors' copyright. Considering from this point, it seems DRM protection is quite reasonable. However, when you purchase EPUB books from stores like Barnes and Noble, Kobo, you can only read them on fixed devices, not allowed to read them in your iBooks on iPad or iPhone. How frustrating! 

What's more, if you want to share your books with your family or friends, you need to give your account to them. That's really inconvenient. Luckily, if you crack EPUB DRM, you are allowed to share your EPUB books with your family who own any devices except Kindle(Kindle device supports AZW, MOBI, AZW3 formats). You are also able to freely transfer or read your EPUB books on more devices, such as iPad and iPhone.

In all, you can remove EPUB DRM use python script rar for your own use since you have paid the money for your books and you have the right to dominate your own books.
