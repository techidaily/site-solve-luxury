[Copy functions from Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/7/2016 10:45:43 PM 

Calibre's success majorly depends on those varieties of plugin in my personal point of view. No-doubt the Alf's DRM Removal plugins are the super stars among them. But many people are saying the Calibre's interface and user-experience are not that friendly for tech noobs. No mention the plugin installation, which would be another challenge for them.

[New Kindle version](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 12/12/2022 1:45:00 AM 

Hello,  
 I purchased epubor ultimate to get a pdf copy of my kindle purchased ebooks.  
 I kept as much as possible the older version of kindle for mac (44173) but, having to a new macbook with ventura IOS, it is no longer possible to use that version.  
 The new one doesn't not allow to retrieve the single ebooks to be dragged and dropped into epubor but I only get a unique file (book\_asset.db) and I don't know how to proceed.  
 Is there any new procedure available to overcome this change/protection?  
 Thank you for your support.

[Can Kindle Transfer rip magazines from a kindle device?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) \-- 6/6/2020 3:20:21 PM 

Hello :)

 Currently the vast majority of publishers only allow kindle magazine subscriptions to be read on a kindle device and not the pc. Can Kindle Transfer copy the magazines from the kindle device to the pc?

 Warm regards.

[Tried unsuccessfully to remove DRM from NOOK books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/6/2019 1:05:53 PM 

I've tried a number of ways to get DRM removed from NOOK books. all unsuccessful. (epubor ultimate, calibre/deDRM)  
 no luck. Has anyone been successful in making this work in 2019? it seems changes were made at end of 2018 to make this more difficult.

 If your software can do this, I will be purchasing it. I was attempting this with Trial copy. if I need a license to make this work, please let me know...jpal

When I use the Amazon "Send to Kindle" function with a book that's gone through your software to remove drm, the content on the Kindle is very messed up with strange characters throughout. When I copy the same file to my iPad, it's just fine. Have you had reports of "Send to Kindle" messing up your drm removed files?

[Book contents out of order](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/19/2024 5:15:07 AM 

Several of the recent books that I have removed DRM and converted to AZW3 have their chapters out of order. When reading sometimes the book goes back to an earlier chapter or randomly jump ahead and skips several chapters. This only occurs on Kindle Paperwhite readers (I have two) and it does the same thing on both of them. However, they (exact same AZW3 files) read perfectly using the app FBreader.

 Here is the method I am using to obtain and decrypt the books. When a book is available in the "my content" area of Amazon I select the book and download by USB. I then drag the downloaded file into Epubor Ultimate. It is decrypted and then I click "Convert to AZW3". When conversion is successful the book is saved to my computer. I then copy it to my Paperwhite reader (or FBreader app). Do you have any experience with this kind of problem? Any thoughts or suggestions would be very appreciated.

 Thank you.
