Where are my Calibre books stored?

[Calibre Plugin installed but failed to remove DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/6/2019 2:06:47 PM 

I'm sure I've installed the latest version of Calibre Plugin zip file. But finally I still failed to remove DRM with Calibre DeDRM plugins. Who can tell me why and how to?

[convert kfx with calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/20/2018 11:38:45 AM 

Can I use Calibre to convert Kindle KFX format eBooks now? How to?

[Copy functions from Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/7/2016 10:45:43 PM 

Calibre's success majorly depends on those varieties of plugin in my personal point of view. No-doubt the Alf's DRM Removal plugins are the super stars among them. But many people are saying the Calibre's interface and user-experience are not that friendly for tech noobs. No mention the plugin installation, which would be another challenge for them.

[where is the cover](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 9/12/2019 7:17:03 PM 

there is no cover after converting the files. do I have to import all books into calibre and look for the metadata there?

[OEB converter?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/8/2021 5:48:11 AM 

Extracted an ebook hoopla file from my phone SD card, which appears to be an OEB file. Trying to get the file into suitable format for Kindle (awz, epub, mobi, etc). The Kindle is not a Fire. Highlighting the files to open in Calibre tries to create 76 separate books! Online forums in past suggested trying Sigil or MobiCreator (which I don't have). Any way in Epubor Ultimate???

[Duplicate chapters in Mobi conversion](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/19/2020 1:43:30 AM 

Is anybody else having the issue where there are multiple copies of each chapter in a Mobi conversion of a Kindle book? After decrypting each Kindle book, I convert it to a Mobi file and then upload that Mobi file to calibre. Upon reading, I see at least three copies of the same chapter before I can access the next chapter, OR after reading a few chapters, I then get a repeat of those same three chapters. It's maddening!

[Issue With Kindle Books and Reader for PC 1.26](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/reader/) \-- 9/9/2019 8:33:01 PM 

Just purchased Epubor on the basis it concerts ALL Kindle books as advertised however it clearly doesn't.

 Your fix on the website has several issues. Firstly even just finding an older version of Kindle Reader for PC that works is impossible. Do you have working link to an older version. Using the method you suggest can in fact be done completely free of charge using Calibre.

 Attempted to start a Live Chat nearly a hour ago but still waiting.

 Can you advise if this issue will be fixed or have I have I just wasted £48 on software that doesn't work?

[Getting syntax error msg](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 9/30/2020 2:18:13 PM 

I'm trying to add DeDRM 6.6.3 to Calibre 5.0.1 on MacOs. I keep getting a syntax error msg and am not allowed to proceed.

[DRM from Kindle, conver not allowed either](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2020 1:07:11 AM 

10th gen Kindle touch. I just tried the 1st option from you tutorial on how to remove DRM Kindle (LINK: https://epubor.com/3-ways-to-remove-drm-from-kindle-books.html). I have been using Calibre for some time. Ver 3.43.0.0\. It did "not" work. Then I saw this at the bottom of page: Update: (Due to a change in DRM) Calibre DeDRM plugins will no longer work with Kindle for PC/Mac version 1.25 or newer or with Kindle firmware 5.10.2 or newer.   
 Then this:  
 You will find that after downloading kindle books to computer via Kindle for PC 1.25, it's likely that we can't remove DRM from those books.   
 SHUCKS!   
 Does this mean that none of the three tutorials will work? 

 Thanks for a quick answer, I do not wish to try all the tutorials if they do not work.

Want to xfer the books from Epubor to Calibre. That is where I keep all of my epub books. Can this be performed? 

[Tried unsuccessfully to remove DRM from NOOK books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/6/2019 1:05:53 PM 

I've tried a number of ways to get DRM removed from NOOK books. all unsuccessful. (epubor ultimate, calibre/deDRM)  
 no luck. Has anyone been successful in making this work in 2019? it seems changes were made at end of 2018 to make this more difficult.

 If your software can do this, I will be purchasing it. I was attempting this with Trial copy. if I need a license to make this work, please let me know...jpal

[Comparing Epubor with Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/1/2021 2:50:47 AM 

I have used Calibre in many years and admire the fine work that Covid Goyal has put there. I have even more than once paid him a "voluntary" donation.  
 So, I find it quite reasonable to pay some money for a good product.  
 Now I have become aware of Epubor and I am pleased to see that you mention Calibre with great respect.  
 But then I'm curious to hear if there's anything Epubor can do that Calibre can't?

[Output whole book as Text File with License.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/9/2020 11:27:01 PM 

Seems like the program won't strip the DRM or whatever after all, total waste of money, none of the converters (zamzar, calibre ect. can convert the amz to pdf bcuz' they claim the DRM is still on).   
 I can't find a way to convert the entire book into a text file, even though without the license you can do that for 20% of the book.   
 Is there an option for that somewhere that I'm missing, or can you at least add it? I really want to do that for 100% of the book.

[Opening in another program after conversion](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/27/2020 8:25:20 AM 

I batch deDrm'd nook books and only some of them were successful. Others said they weren't downloaded completely, but I don't know what that means. I downloaded them on the nook app, so how much further can I download them?

 Also, the ones that WERE successful, I can't seem to open them in different programs now, specifically Calibre. Is this software attempting to make you use their eReader to view the books after conversion?

[converting kindle books on MacBook Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/17/2020 2:40:49 AM 

I can't find my kindle content on the MacBook Pro or convert it with ePub. The software won't allow use of the old version, and nothing is coming up with the new kindle version. Could you please give me a step by step of how to use epub to remove drm and send to calibre?
