We purchased for some interesting ebooks online, but when we download them we only got ACSM files intead of real ebooks. If you tried to read such ACSM files on your Nook, you'll find that you couldn't do it. You may be confused: How can I open the ACSM files? How to read ACSM on my Nook device? Don't worry, here I will tell you 2 useful ways to read ACSM on Nook. Then you can enjoy your downloaded ACSM files on your Nook device freely.

### Method 1\. Convert ACSM to EPUB/PDF With ADE

What's an ACSM file? I believe most of you may be confused about this file. In fact, it's a link that allows you to download the complete EPUB or PDF books. Usually it's protected by Adobe DRM. If we want to read it on our Nook device, we can only open it with Adobe Digital Editions (ADE), then convert it to common EPUB or PDF format and transfer to our Nook eReader. In this part, I will tell you how to convert ACSM to EPUB/PDF with ADE.

Step 1 **Convert ACSM to EPUB/PDF with ADE**

Only ADE can open and read the ACSM files, so please make sure that you have [downloaded the Adobe Digital Edtions](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html) to your computer.

The first time you use ADE, it will let you authorize the computer with your Adobe account. If you don't have yet, you can click "Create an Adobe ID" to get a new account. Then authorize it.

Next, just drag your downloaded ACSM files to the Adobe Digital Editions. It will download the EPUB/PDF books for you automatically. Please make sure your network connection is normal. After the downloading has been finished, the books will show up in ADE. You can open and read them with ADE.

Step 2 **Transfer converted ACSM files to Nook device with ADE**

After converting ACSM to EPUB/PDF successfully, now you can transfer converted books to our Nook device. Connect your Nook eReader to the computer via USB, open ADE on your computer, then you will see your Nook eReader under "Devices" at the left menu bar.

![connect nook color to computer](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/connect-nook-device-to-ade.png)

Then just click and drag an ebook over to your Nook device.

![transfer acsm to nook with ade](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/transfer-acsm-to-nook-with-ade.png)

When the transmission has been finished, just eject your Nook eReader. Then you will find your newly added ACSM files. Click the book cover to read ACSM on your Nook.

**Note:** This method is only accessible for those devices that support Adobe DRM, such as Nook, Sony, Kobo eReader. And you have to make sure that your eReader is authorized with the same Adobe account, otherwise you will be prohibited to open the EPUB/PDF books.

### Method 2\. Remove DRM from ACSM files--The Best Method

ACSM files are usually DRM-protected. If we can remove DRM from ACSM files, we can read them on any devices except Nook eReader. Here just take the following easy steps to remove ACSM DRM.

Step 1 **Convert ACSM to EPUB/PDF with ADE**. (This step is the same as the step mentioned in Method 1)

Step 2 **Download [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)\--the best ACSM DRM Removal**.

Here I recommend you a powerful and easy tool Epubor Ultimate. You can use it to remove Adobe DRM from large quantity books with only a few seconds. Its clean interface makes it easy to use. I believe most of you can know how to operate it. Now you can download it for free and get the tool ready.

So easy to use. Right? No need to manually add books by yourself. No extra steps to remove DRM. Only need to drag books to the left side. Besides, it can handle a lot of books in batch. 

Step 4 **Transfer DRM-free books to Nook via USB**.

After removing ACSM DRM successfully, now it's time to transfer the DRM-free books to your Nook eReader.

First, connect Nook device to your computer with USB, open your Nook drive and select the folder "My Document".

Second, drag the decrypted books (you can find the decrypted books by clicking the word "Decrypted" at the end of the book title to open the folder which stores your decrypted books) to "My Document" folder in the Nook drive.

Finally, eject your Nook device. Go to your library on the Nook and tap "My Documents", you will see your transferred books there. 

Once the DRM has been removed, you can transfer decrypted books to your Nook eReader and read them more freely, no need to ensure it's associated with your Adobe account or not. You can even [read ACSM files on Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), as long as you convert ACSM to Mobi format by using Epubor Ultimate's "Convert" feature.

That's all I want to share with you. Hope you have a good reading journey with your Nook device.
