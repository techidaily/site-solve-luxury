Can I read Kindle books on Kobo? You may have this doubt when you find an interesting book but only sold on Amazon store, not Kobo. Therefore, you have to buy it from Amazon. But imagine that you just have a Kobo eReader, so questions coming: Can I read Kindle books on Kobo? How can I read Kindle books on Kobo?

I believe many people have this kind of confusion. This guide will help you read your Kindle books on Kobo freely.

### Why can't we directly read Kindle on Kobo?

It's known that Amazon Kindle books are special for Kindle devices. It's formats are not completely compatible with Kobo readers format epub and pdf. Besides, Kindle books we buy online are usually DRM protected.

Kobo official website has also declared that.

![kobo official website](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kobo-official-website.jpg) 

In a word, here are 2 reasons that we can't directly read our Kindle books on Kobo:  

* Kindle books are with DRM protection
* Kindle books are with Kindle format, not common epub or pdf

 Now let's learn about how to read Kindle books on Kobo.

### How to read Kindle books on Kobo tablet? 

This way is to help you read Kindle azw files on Kobo tablet, such as Kobo Arc, Kobo Arc 7, Kobo Arc 7 HD, etc.

**Tip:** As Kobo tablet is based on Android system, so I recommend you install the Kindle for Android app in your Kobo.

1  Go to Amazon's official site, and download the[Kindle for Android app](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-com-Kindle-for-Android/dp/B004DLPXAO/)and install it in your Kobo tablet.

2 Open the app and register it with your own Amazon account.

3 Buy and download books you like. After downloading the books, you can read them on your Kobo tablet freely.

### How to read Kindle books on Kobo glo/aura?

If you want to read Kindle books on your Kobo e-ink readers, such as Kobo glo, Kobo aura, Kobo touch, etc, which you can't install app on them, you'll need to convert kindle books to Kobo supported format--EPUB.
