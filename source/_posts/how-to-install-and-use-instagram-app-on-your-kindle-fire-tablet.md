Instagram is the world famous online social network service for photo and video sharing. Like other popular social network, for example Facebook and Twitter, Instagram has also launched an app used on cellphone and tablet. People can easily get Instagram app in Google Play and iOS AppStore so that they can enjoy sharing photo and videos on their Android phone, iPhone and iPad. But for people who use Kindle Fire, the situation gets a bit embarrassing – You can't find Instagram in the Kindle Fire App Store!

Search 'Instagram" in Kindle Fire App Store. You can only find a list of apps with their name looking like Instagram but you can't find the real "Instagram". The only official Instagram client is the "Instafire". But this app is totally a joke – it costs you $2.99 but you can't post pictures! You may not believe that but it's the truth! Actually the Kindle Fire App Store has less apps comparing with Google Play. Many popular apps can't be found in it.

But don't worry. We can still use Instagram on Kindle Fire. This article is all about it.

### How to Get Instagram on Kindle Fire

First, make sure your Kindle Fire can install third-party apps. Tap the top of Kindle Fire screen to call out the quick setting menu. Tap "More" – "Device" and choose "Allow Installation of Applications". Tap "ON" to enable this feature. Then you can install apps which are not from Kindle Fire App Store.

 Search "Instagram apk" in the search box and click "Search".

After the downloading has been finished you will be asked to install the app. Just confirm the request and install. Then you can use Instagram on your Kindle Fire!

Oh thank you so much Eddie. This worked wonderful. I downloaded to my kindle fire and my son's android. We no nothing about the technical aspects of our tablets, as we have so little time to be on the internet. We have to go to the library and use their wi-fi. But, your step by step instructions and pictures were excellent!!  
 I tried to give you 5 gold stars, but it only let me do 4 and 90% of the last one in red!  
 Thanks again for your kindness to strangers.

Thank you. This worked for me. On my version of the Kindle, it was under settings&gt;apps rather than more to give permission for outside apps. Also, to find the download, I had to go into the browser, swipe right to get the menu, and find it in downloads there. Took me a second search to figure that out, but it finally worked. Thank you so much!

Wonderful. Except attempting to register gets repeated error messages. Amazon is simply at rookie level as far as apps go and the ods of a non-amazon app working is very low. Ho many kindles was this tested on before publishing it? None? One?

I got a Kindle Fire last Christmas, but there was no instagram on its app store. So, I find out the app store is NOT the only the place to get apps on Amazon. So, I went to some downloads website and found Instagram. The download AND install was successful. I never figured out how to get the new Instagram, as I still have the old Insta, with the old logo.
