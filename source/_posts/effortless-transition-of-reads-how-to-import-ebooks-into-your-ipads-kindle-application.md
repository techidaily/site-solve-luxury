Since you want to transfer books to iPad kindle app, then you should first install kindle app on iPad. Here are the steps for you to install the kindle app: 

**1.** Tap the App Store icon on the home screen of your iPad. You can also get this app through the iTunes stores.

**2.** Type "Kindle" in the search pane of the app store and click the search button.

**3.** Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

After getting this step ready, you can follow the guide below. Just choose the "proper" part, OK.
