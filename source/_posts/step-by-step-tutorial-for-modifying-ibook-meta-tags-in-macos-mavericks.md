## Step-by-Step Tutorial for Modifying iBook Meta Tags in macOS Mavericks

## How to Edit iBooks Meta Data under Mac OS X Mavericks

Dated back to the WWDC 2013, when Apple announced iBooks would be an independent application in the OS X 10.9 Mavericks, all the iBooks lovers are exciting about the coming iBooks for Mac app. Finally the day came, but I heard much noise among the cheers. A lot of people think the iBooks for Mac sucks, because it doesn't allow people to edit the metadata.

### People can't edit eBooks metadata in iBooks for Mac

Some people may even don't know what is metadata, to put it simply, metadata is the ID card for an eBook, like the cover, title, author name, publisher name, etc.

For those people who purchase eBooks from iBooks Store only, they might feel there is no need to edit the metadata. But a hard-core eBook fan won't think so, many downloaded eBooks don't have a complete meta information, like lack of cover or improper title spelling.

When the iBooks was only a child-column in iTunes, we can right click on an item then click "Get Info" to edit a book's metadata just like modifying a song's ID3 tag information.

But with iBooks for Mac in Mavericks, you only get this when right clicking on a book.

![ibooks-for-mac-options](http://www.epubor.com/images/ibooks-for-mac-options.png)

Sad story, feels like we are using a lite edition of iBooks, isn't it?

The reason that iBooks enables people to edit the meta date is pretty obvious-- they don't want people to use iBooks to read downloaded books, but only the books purchased from iBooks Store.

### Edit metadata with Calibre for Mac

Although editing metadata with iBooks is impossible, it doesn't mean this is the end of the story. With another software, Calibre for Mac, we can edit book's metadata then load the book into iBooks for Mac app.

First we import the book into Calibre.

![ibooks without cover](http://www.epubor.com/images/ibooks-without-cover.png)

From the image above we can see that the cover of the book _A DANCE WITH DRAGONS_ is missing, which is a pretty typical case where we need to edit the metadata to add cover.![edit-metadata-in-calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/edit-metadata-in-calibre.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094482/7443" target="_top" id="2094482">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>
</a>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094482/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Right click on the book title, choose "Edit metadata", then "Edit metadata individually".

![](http://www.epubor.com/images/edit-metadata-for-ibooks-for-mac.png)

In this window we can customize almost all the important metadata. In this case I need to add a cover to the book, so I click "Browse" in "Change cover" area. If you want to make it simple, just directly click "Download cover", and Calibre will search the cover from internet and add it for you.

![cover-added-by-calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/cover-added-by-calibre.png)

After finding the cover image, click "OK" to confirm. Then you can see the cover in Calibre now.

But job has not been finished yet, in fact the cover is only added in Calibre's library. To display the book's cover in iBooks for Mac, we need to add the cover image into the book file.

No matter that we are adding cover or modifying the names, **converting the book to EPUB again**  is necessary. Only in this way, we can completely edit the metadata inside the book, not only in Calibre library.

So the last step is to convert the book to EPUB, even this file is already an EPUB file.

### Load the modified book into iBooks for Mac

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Find the converted file in Calibre's library and drag it into iBooks for Mac. Now we can see the book displayed in iBooks for Mac with the gorgeous cover.

Using the same method we can also add or modify other metadata like title, author & publisher, genre, etc. On Mac OS X Mavericks even the iBooks for Mac enable us to do so.

Thank you very much. I've been looking for a tool to edit all my ebooks for months. Plus, the possibility to load metadatas directly from Google or Amazon is amazing.

I have been using Calibre and iBooks on the iPad for 2 years now and its all been ok. 

 But now with the OS Mavericks, everything has changed. I did as you suggested, dragged the books from Calibre to iBooks on my mac (my Calibre library is perfectly organised with all the meta data in place). Unfortunately all this effort is in vain when I transfer to iBooks - it all disappears. Any suggestions?

 Thanks.

Yup, that's what I mean. It remains edited and organised in Calibre, but in ibooks, it reverts to the original downloaded data.

After editing the meta data in Calibre, convert the book to EPUB again even it is already an EPUB.

 Then drag the converted EPUB to iBooks and check the result.

After editing the meta data, you need to convert it to EPUB again to write the new meta data into the book.

I have tried this and still am not having any success getting the metadata from Calibre to iBooks. I am running OS X 10.9.4, iBooks 1.01 and Calibre 1.48\. I have tried downloading the metadata and then reconverting the book in ePub format and still no luck. Any idea what I might be missing or doing wrong?

After converting the book from EPUB to EPUB in Calibre, the new EPUB won't replace the old one.

 So please make sure you are viewing the new EPUB file.

Jonny, I've verified that I am using the correct file and still no metadata. Even when I convert other file types, mobi, azw3 to epub the metadata still is lost. There must be something I am doing wrong if others are not having the same issue.

not only it would be nice to solve the "calibre to ibook issue", with all the changes in metadata file done through calibre,   
 it would be great to get ibook sync those updates in metadata files automatically, or even add new ibook, (once the calibre library had change) is there a way to get this?

Hi, thank you for the informations. I use Calibre because I read on iPad but also on eReader. Since Mavericks is on, I can't import my ebboks (those I bought on iTunes store): I Know where they are (the hidden files, blabla) but Calibre don't recognize them... Do you know how to put ebooks from itunes store in Calibre?

 I just figured out a way to get iTunes back to managing my books and pdfs (removed iBooks and use BookReader app for mac OS X to read locally. BookReader allows to import from iTunes and has it's own book shelf screen.   
  
 1.) Kill the bookstoreagent service using the Activity Monitor.  
 2.) Delete the file for that service: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/bo okstoreagent  
 3.) Use AppCleaner (free app for mac OS X) to get rid of iBooks.  
  
 Problem solved!

Thanks for using inflated reviews to induce me to buy your product only to find it fails, then for having the gall to guide me through using the tried-and-true Calibre to do what you can't. No one in their right mind would go to all this trouble when Calibre does it all! I tried your product because my Calibre library is large and on a remote server. You might have mentioned in all those glowing reviews that you don't work at all on Mac. And take some grammar lessons, for heaven's sake!

Is there command line access to epub metadata?

 I have 9,000 pub documents that I want to enter into a database. I'm NOT going to use a graphical user interface (like Calibre) to do that! :-)
